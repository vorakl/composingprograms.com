# Practicing ideas from the "Composing Programs"

My experiments inspired by ["Composing Programs"](https://composingprograms.com) which is authored and maintained by John DeNero.

* [char_converter](char_converter/), the example of applying the constraint programming paradigm for converting Characters to/from Ascii codes
* [pure_oop](pure_oop/), a pure implementation of the Object-Oriented Paradigm (encapsulation, polymorphism, inheritance) in one function
