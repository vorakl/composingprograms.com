# Pure OOP

A pure implementation of Object-Oriented Paradigm in one function.
It is using functional abstraction, closures, and dictionaries.

Implemented:
* encapsulation, polymorphism, inheritance
* class attributes and methods

This work is inspired by [OOP implementation by John DeNero](https://composingprograms.com/pages/26-implementing-classes-and-objects.html) and Perl's language native Object model.
