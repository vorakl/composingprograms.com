# Pure OOP

A pure implementation of the Object-Oriented Paradigm in just **one function**.
The solution uses functional abstraction, closures, and dictionaries.

Implemented features:
* encapsulation, polymorphism, inheritance
* class attributes and class methods

This design is inspired by the [OOP implementation by John DeNero](https://composingprograms.com/pages/26-implementing-classes-and-objects.html) and [Perl's language native Object model](http://users.monash.edu/~damian/papers/PDF/cyberdigest.pdf).
