# Char Converter

The example of implementing a constraint programming paradigm for converting Characters to/from Ascii codes.

The System (a network built of connectors and constraints):                   
small ascii <-> (code) <-> small letter <-> (aA) <-> capital letter <-> (code) <-> capital ascii

A system allows to set a value of any connector and get a calculated result   
on all other connectors by propagating updates using the Massage passing approach
